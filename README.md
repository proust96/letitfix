# Let it fix
Our submission for the OpenBanking Hackathon 2018.

The solution combines a innovative way for users to find their issues, a chatbot, powered by IBM Watson Assistant, to understand natural language, and finally a deep analysis of data - collected automatically and by feedback.
This allows the system to improve over trial, in order to make the most out of the time of the support team.

There is a live demo running [here](http://letitfix.poleno.fr/), showcasing our issue map, and some chatbot interactions.

[Here](https://github.com/proust96/chatbot_back) is a link to a backend for our bot, which is a connector to IBM Cloud. We use the assitant to determine the user's intent, make small talk, understand basic commands (e.g. "go back one step").
